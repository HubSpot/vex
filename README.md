Vex is a modern dialog library which is highly configurable, easily stylable, and gets out of the way. You'll love vex because it's tiny (`10.2kb` minified, `3.8kb` minified + gzipped), has **no dependencies**, has a clear and simple API, works on mobile devices, and can be customized to match your style in seconds.

### Note: docs are not updated with breaking changes made from HubSpot's vex
