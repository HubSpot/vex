Vex is a modern dialog library which is highly configurable, easily stylable, and gets out of the way. You'll love vex because it's tiny (`6kb` minified, `2kb` minified + gzipped), has a clear and simple API, works on mobile devices, and can be customized to match your style in seconds.

## What to Use Vex for and When to Use It

Did it ever happen that you are browsing an amazingly styled web page and suddenly you get a very dull pop-up dialog? Or maybe you created one yourself? I'm willing to bet it did happen and more than once.

Vex will spare you the experience. Make sure that your pop-ups go hand in hand with your page by using Vex. You want to use it for every page to add that final touch that will take your work up another level.
